However, it is important to note that margarine often contains trans fats, which have been linked to adverse health effects. Optimal consumption involves limiting the intake of trans fats and using margarine sparingly as a cooking oil or spread. Regular intake of 100% vegetable margarine should be balanced with a diverse and nutrient-rich diet to ensure overall well-being.","fats":84.0,"proteins":0.6,"foodId":"c3c7b7ed-b41d-403d-90e1-6ee89bc09e35","name":"Vegetable Margarine","calories":760.0,"category":"Cheese Plant"}}}},{"m":{"type":"node","id":"363","labels":["Food"],"properties":{"carbohydrates":0.7,"knowledgeBase":"Chicory, a member of the vegetable category, is a nutrient-rich food known for its low caloric content (17kcal/100g) and high fiber content.

Studies suggest that regular consumption of dried broad beans may reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease due to their high fiber content and anti-inflammatory properties. Optimal recommendations include incorporating them into a balanced diet as part of a plant-based meal plan, and preparation methods such as soaking and cooking can enhance nutrient bioavailability. The unique presence of phytonutrients, including vicine and convicine, imparts potential health benefits, but further research is warranted to understand their exact roles.","fats":2.1,"proteins":21.3,"foodId":"2dafb5ec-f5a3-4178-9dce-cb633a047fea","name":"Dried Broad Beans","calories":331.0,"category":"Vegetable"}}}},{"m":{"type":"node","id":"959","labels":["Food"],"properties":{"carbohydrates":75.1,"knowledgeBase":"Mais, a staple grain rich in carbohydrates (75.1g per 100g), provides a substantial source of energy.
